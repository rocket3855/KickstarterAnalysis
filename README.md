Data Analysis of Kickstarter Projects

Overview
The goal of the project was to analyze the data provided in the module. The data represented in the analysis was about Kickstarter projects. The dataset initially included the following categories: id, name, blurb, goal, pledged, outcomes, country, currency, deadline, launched_at, staff_pick, backers_count, spotlight, Category. After receiving the data altercations were made. These altercations included dividing the category column into  parent and subcategory columns, making new columns and organizing data based on the new columns. The purpose of this projects is to determine the different campaigns that were also completed and how long they took. This information will be used by Lousie to determine if her play is worth pursuing.

Analysis and Challenges
The challenges that were discovered during the project were producing the correct chart for the desired outcome. For example, the chart that was made to determine the outcome of the kick starters that were plays and the corresponding success rate percentages. Below is a pivot chart made with excel to determine the outcomes if the theaters based on their launch dates. This chart was derived from the dataset and organized by month. From looking at this chart, one can see that the overall number of ventures that were successful is more than the ventures that failed or were canceled for unknown causes.

Along with this another line graph displays the outcomes based on their goals. This graph shows a contradicting perspective with the top graph because it seems to represent a 50/50 split on whether a projects success will achieve its goal.

Results
The above charts show that if Louise were to start a theater venture the pay off will be in her favor. The data pulled from the data set corresponds with a higher success rate than that of a failure rate. This shows it would be beneficial for her to start the project than to look for a different one. Overall, the outcomes based on goals are the most accurate representation of the projects success rate. This is because the graph shows that the higher the goal is for the project to be successful is a correlation. For instance, a project with a low goal rate had a higher failure rate and vice versa. The outcomes based on launch date show that a project has a higher chance of success when it is started in May. One can also conclude that the level of canceled projects is consistently low throughout the year.
